Given your moderate risk tolerance, if you currently hold AAPL stock, it might be wise to maintain your position for now, closely monitoring the company's next earnings report and any strategic announcements that might impact its stock performance. The sentiment score, though on the lower end, suggests not all news is negative, indicating potential for recovery.\n",
