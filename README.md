## 🌟 Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with AgentNeo in just a few steps!

### 1. Import the Necessary Components

```python
from agentneo import AgentNeo, Tracer, Evaluation, launch_dashboard
```

### 2. Create a Session and Project

```python
neo_session = AgentNeo(session_name="my_session")
neo_session.create_project(project_name="my_project")
```

### 3. Initialize the Tracer

```python
tracer = Tracer(session=neo_session)
tracer.start()
```

### 4. Instrument Your Code

Wrap your functions with AgentNeo's decorators to start tracing:

```python
@tracer.trace_llm("my_llm_call")
async def my_llm_function():
    # Your LLM call here
    pass

@tracer.trace_tool("my_tool")
def my_tool_function():
    # Your tool logic here
    pass

@tracer.trace_agent("my_agent")
def my_agent_function():
    # Your agent logic here
    pass
```

### 5. Evaluate your AI Agent's performance

```python
exe = Evaluation(session=neo_session, trace_id=tracer.trace_id)

# run a single metric
exe.evaluate(metric_list=['metric_name'])
```

```python
# get your evaluated metrics results
metric_results = exe.get_results()
print(metric_results)
```

### 6. Stop Tracing and Launch the Dashboard

```python
tracer.stop()

launch_dashboard(port=3000)
```

Access the interactive dashboard by visiting `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Project Management

Manage multiple projects with ease.

- **List All Projects**

  ```python
  projects = neo_session.list_projects()
  ```

- **Connect to an Existing Project**

  ```python
  neo_session.connect_project(project_name="existing_project")
  ```

### Metrics Evaluation
#### Supported Metrics
1. Goal Decomposition Efficiency ([goal_decomposition_efficiency](https://docs.raga.ai/agentneo/metric-library/goal-decomposition-efficiency))
2. Goal Fulfillment Rate (goal_fulfillment_rate)
3. Tool Call Correctness Rate (tool_call_correctness_rate)
4. Tool Call Success Rate (tool_call_success_rate)

- **Run multiple metrics together**
```python
exe.evaluate(metric_list=['metric_name1', 'metric_name2', ..])
```

- **Use your own config and metadata related to the metric**
```python
exe.evaluate(metric_list=['metric_name'], config={}, metadata={})

## sample config and metadata
# config = {"model": "gpt-4o-mini"}
# metadata = {
#     "tools": [
#       {
#         "name": "flight_price_estimator_tool",
#         "description": "flight_price_estimator_tool"
#       },
#       {
#         "name": "currency_converter_tool",
#         "description": "currency_converter_tool"
#       },
#     ]
#   }
```
